        <h3>My first move</h3>
        <p>I made the first move by DM-ing Jessie first. At that time, I was so confused about how to start the conversation because Jessie rarely posted any stories—so I had no clue what topic to begin with! But instead of overthinking, I figured I might as well just go for it. AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!</p>

        <h3>First meet</h3>
        <p>Meeting Jessie for the first time was the most exciting and nerve-wracking moment of the day. We went on a movie date and watched an F1 film. After the movie, we chatted and yapped away, getting to know each other better. The photobox session was still pretty awkward at that point—HAHAHAHAHAHA!. 💌</p>

        <h3>Our second photobox</h3>
        <p>Our second photobox session at Walking Drums café in Margonda helped me and Jessie get to know each other even better. We had a full conversation from late afternoon all the way into the night. It made me really happy to feel even closer to her. ☕🍰</p>
